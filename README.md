Problem identified: During the pandemic, many companies have been forced to adopt flexible and remote working arrangements. To improve motivation among the employees, our project aims to bring RPG elements into a work productivity application specifically for Software Developers. 

Our solution: A gamified Software Project Management tool for easy remote team and task management.
