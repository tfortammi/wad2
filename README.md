# ProjectQuest

Problem identified: During the pandemic, many companies have been forced to adopt flexible and remote working arrangements. To improve motivation among the employees, our project aims to bring RPG elements into a work productivity application specifically for Software Developers. 

Our solution: A gamified Software Project Management tool for easy remote team and task management.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following libraries.

```bash
pip install flask
pip install flask_sqlalchemy
pip install flask_cors
pip install firebase_admin
```
We have included a `readme/requirements.txt` file that you can use to recursively install the necessary python libraries.

## Usage
In order to run the Web Application, first start running the `api/main.py` file 

If you are using Windows OS, you may use the following commands:
```bash
cd api/
python main.py
```

If you are using Machintosh OS, you may use the following commands:
```bash
cd api/
python main.py
```
